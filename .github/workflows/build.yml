    steps:
    # Step 1: Check out your repository code
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # Step 2: Set up the necessary system tools that Buildozer needs
    - name: Set up system dependencies
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y \

      run: |
        pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install buildozer cython

    # Step 5: Run the Buildozer command to create the APK
    - name: Build with Buildozer
      run: |
        # Add a specific build-tools version to the spec file to ensure it's downloaded
        # This is a robust way to make sure buildozer finds its tools, like 'aidl'.

        # Now, run the actual build command.
