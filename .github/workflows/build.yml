    # Step 2: Set up the necessary system tools that Buildozer needs
    - name: Set up system dependencies

    # Step 5: Run the Buildozer command to create the APK
    - name: Build with Buildozer
      run: |
        # First, let buildozer set up the Android SDK and NDK.
        # This command is designed to download dependencies without a full build.
        buildozer android update -v

        # Now, find the path to the build-tools directory, which contains 'aidl'.
        # We use a wildcard (*) because the version number in the directory name can change.
